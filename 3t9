<h1>Welcome to My Favourite Teams</h1>
<p>Cricket is my favourite sport. Cricket is a sport that is widely
played across the globe and it is played by everyone irrespective of their
caste, creed or colour. It is also called the Gentleman’s Game as it was played
by British officers back in the 16th century.
I play cricket every day in the evening with my neighbourhood friends.
Although we don’t obey the rules of cricket, it is a great source of physical
exercise and entertainment. We play in a team of 5 versus 5 whereas in this
game of cricket each team has 11 members.</p>
