<h1>Welcome to My Hobbies page</h1>
<p>All work and no play makes your life dull. So you need fun activities
too. Hobbies are activities that are fun, entertaining and relaxing. Your hobby
can be educative too. There are many kinds of hobbies. People pursue their
hobbies with great passion and zest. Developing a hobby for your self will
prove to be useful. Hobbies will help you use your leisure time gainfully. Your
hobbies may be lifelong. You can pursue more than one hobby too.
Music, dance, reading, story writing, sports, philately, painting and
theatre may all be hobbies. Interestingly, one person’s profession may be
another person’s hobby. For instance, one could be a professional flautist, but
for another playing the flute could be a hobby. A hobby is a fun activity that
is pursued during one’s leisure hours.</p>
